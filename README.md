# 📚 NLP Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This repository includes a set of projects focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating text classification and sentiment analysis tasks across three notebooks.

## 📓 Notebooks

### 🎥 Sentiment Analysis (IMDb Reviews)
- **Objective**: Analyze IMDb movie reviews to determine sentiment.
- **Approach**: Utilizes Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, and Gaussian Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.
- **Techniques**: Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, Naive Bayes Classification.
- **Dataset**: IMDb reviews dataset.

### ❓ Multiclass Classification (Question Topics)
- **Objective**: Categorize questions into different topics.
- **Approach**: Employs Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, and Gaussian Naive Bayes for multiclass classification.
- **Techniques**: Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, Naive Bayes Classification.
- **Dataset**: Question topic dataset.

### 📊 Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
- **Objective**: Sentiment analysis using a pipeline approach, comparing various classifiers.
- **Approach**: Utilizes Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, and different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) within a pipeline.
- **Techniques**: Count Vectorization, TF-IDF Transformation, Multiclass Classification.
- **Dataset**: IMDb reviews dataset.
